0-0 = R Lynne, are you prepared to begin your training?
0-1 = L I've been ready for a while now...
0-2 = R Then let us begin with the basics of movement. One cannot properly approach their opponent in battle if they do not understand the motion of combat.
0-3 = R Take your first steps.
0-4 = N Move forward or back on the joystick/directional pad to walk in that direction.
0-5 = END
1-0 = R Now, crouching.
1-1 = N Move down on the joystick to crouch.
1-2 = END
2-0 = R Crouching has many uses, one of them being that you can perform different attacks in this position.
2-1 = R I will go over that soon, but first, jumping.
2-2 = N Press up, up-left, or up-right to jump in that direction
2-3 = END
3-0 = R Jumping allows you to avoid some of your opponent's attacks on the ground like projectiles or charging attacks.
3-1 = R You can also jump for an opportunity to attack from above. But be warned, jumping at the opponent can be risky if they expect it.
3-2 = R You can channel your powers to alter your position in the air. One such way is to ascend higher while performing a jump.
3-3 = L So, like a second jump?
3-4 = R You could think of it like that, I suppose.
3-5 = N Move up again after jumping once to perform another jump.
3-6 = END
4-0 = R Be warned that this will keep you in the air longer, which can leave you even more vulnerable.
4-1 = R Sometimes, closing the distance requires reckless movement. Running leaves you open to retaliation, but is necessary to get in close and attack
4-2 = N Tap forward twice to run towards your opponent.
4-3 = END
5-0 = R Other times, the opposite is true, and you must put distance between yourself and a tough opponent. Dashing away is the best option in this case.
5-1 = N Tap backward twice to perform a short hop away from the opponent.
5-2 = END
6-0 = R A backdash is strong option to evade enemy attacks and create space between the opponent.
6-1 = R Lastly, you can alter your position in the air similarly to how you 'dash' on the ground.
6-2 = N Tapping forward or backward twice in the air will perform an 'air dash' in that direction.
6-3 = END
7-0 = R Airdashing can give you the opportunity to close the distance between you and your opponent and begin close combat, or give you an alternate way to space yourself from them.
7-1 = R With the basics of movement finished, I must next teach you how to properly defend yourself when the time comes.
7-2 = R Hold your defensive stance while I strike at you.
7-3 = L Don't I get to hit back?
7-4 = N Hold the joystick away from the opponent to block their attacks.
7-5 = END
8-0 = R Good. Defending yourself is easy and can put you in a position to counter attack if your opponent uses a powerful move with great recovery.
8-1 = R However, simply blocking will not always stop your opponent's attacks from coming through. If your opponent strikes at your feet while you are standing, you won't be able to defend yourself.
8-2 = R If you block that attack while crouching, you can defend against it. Do so now.
8-3 = N Hold down and away from the opponent to block the opponent's low-hitting attack.
8-4 = END
9-0 = R Low-hitting attacks can be quite fast, so you should always defend low while your opponent is on the ground.
9-1 = R When your opponent is in the air, all of their attacks will hit from above, and cannot be blocked while crouching. Thus, you should block those attacks while standing.
9-2 = R The best way to defend against an opponent overall is to first block low, and then block high on reaction.
9-3 = R You can also block some attacks while in the air. You don't have to worry about if you are being attacked from above or below, but there are some attacks that cannot be defended against while in the air.
9-4 = R We are now ready to discuss combat techniques.
9-5 = R An essential part of combat is the use of light attacks: These don't deal much damage, but are the fastest to perform and the best way to start strings of attacks.
9-6 = N Perform a standing, crouching and jumping light attack by pressing the light attack button.
9-7 = END
10-0 = R Medium attacks are slower than light attacks, but deal more damage and have longer reach.
10-1 = N Perform a standing, crouching and jumping medium attack by pressing medium attack button.
10-2 = END
11-0 = R Heavy attacks are the strongest and reach the farthest, but are the slowest normal moves you can use.
11-1 = N Perform a standing, crouching and jumping heavy attack by pressing the heavy attack button.
11-2 = END
12-0 = R You can strike at the opponent with the weakest of your attacks first and then use your stronger attacks after.
12-1 = R However, normal attacks cannot deal damage to the opponent if they are blocking, so it may be necessary to use techniques that can break their guard.
12-2 = R One such way is to grapple them and then strike.
12-3 = N Perform a throw by pressing A and E at the same time when near an opponent.
12-4 = END
13-0 = R You can also throw your opponent behind you to put yourself in a better position
13-1 = N Perform a back-throw by pressing A and E while holding back near your opponent.
13-2 = END
14-0 = R Throwing is a strong offensive technique but it has its weaknesses. For one, you cannot be thrown while you are in the air.
14-1 = R Secondly, you can break out of an opposing throw by starting one of your own at the same time.
14-2 = R As I try to grab you, try to break away from me.
14-3 = N As Randolf tries to throw you, press A and E at around the same time to perform a Throw Break.
14-4 = END
15-0 = R Well done, Lynne. Remember, if you attempt a throw and it does not connect, you will be vulnerable.
15-1 = R Another way to disrupt your opponent's guard is to attack them where they are not prepared to block.
15-2 = R You can do so while performing a jumping attack while they are crouching, but you have another way to attack them from above.
15-3 = R You can jump a smaller distance to perform a much quicker jumping attack.
15-4 = N Press forward and medium attack at the same time to perform a fast overhead attack.
15-5 = END
16-0 = R This a much faster way to attack your opponent from above, but is still slow enough to be reacted to and can be beaten by fast attacks if your opponent can predict it. It is important to use this move in moderation.
16-1 = R Moving on to more advanced techniques, you can channel your energy into a projectile to throw at your opponent. Try to remember the form I taught you for this skill.
16-2 = N Fire a projectile at the opponent by moving the joystick from the down position to the position towards your opponent (NEED IMAGE EXAMPLE HERE!!!!!) and pressing A, B or C.
16-3 = END
17-0 = R Excellent. This is a strong move to use when your opponent is far away.
17-1 = R You can close the gap between your opponent by using a rushing move.
17-2 = N Slide on the ground towards your opponent by moving the joystick from the down position to the position away from your opponent (NEED IMAGE EXAMPLE HERE!!!!!) and pressing A, B or C.
17-3 = N Jetstream Slide has three different follow-ups. Press A, B or C to perform one of these follow ups.
17-4 = END
18-0 = R That slide is a very versatile move, it can even go under some of your opponent's attacks.
18-1 = L It's a bit cooler than your lame old tackle, huh?
18-2 = R You take advantage of your speed, I take advantage of my large frame. There is nothing more to it.
18-3 = L Can't take a joke, huh...?
18-4 = R This next technique is very difficult to perform. It is invulnerable to attacks and launches the opponent into the air.
18-5 = N Move forward on the joystick, then move it to the downwards position, then move it to the down-forward position and hit A, B, or C. (NEED IMAGE EXAMPLE HERE!!!!!) Remember to take your time when learning this move.
18-6 = END
19-0 = R Well done, Lynne. This is an advanced technique, but brings great reward when mastered.
19-1 = R Now before we move on, I must first remind you how to build the energy inside you.
19-2 = N Press and hold E to slowly gain meter, as shown in the lower left corner.
19-3 = END
20-0 = R You slowly build energy through the actions you perform in combat, but this is a more direct way of building it.
20-1 = R This technique requires the energy you just mustered. It releases your stored energy through a powerful flurry of attacks.
20-2 = N Make a quarter-circle forward motion with the joystick and press any two buttons that are not E to perform a super attack.
20-3 = END
21-0 = R Good job. This is an excellent attack to finish off the opponent, but it leaves you greatly vulnerable if you miss or if the opponent blocks it.
21-1 = R That is the last of your base abilities, you must learn them well. They can also be enhanced by by an elemental style of your choosing. Of which there are Life, Death, Space and Time.
21-2 = R The Life enhancement is not specialized, but grants you strong abilities nonetheless and heals you as you land special techniques. This is easy for beginners to master.
21-3 = L You can trap your opponent in vines and give them a major beatdown!
21-4 = R Death increases your ability to deal with long distance enemies and increases the damage done by specials when they are blocked.
21-5 = L And you can get some crazy offense going with it if you know what you're doing.
21-6 = R Space increases your defensive abilities, giving you many abilities to avoid or brush off enemy attacks and allows you to build up energy faster than other elements.
21-7 = L A good choice if you think your defense is your weakest point.
21-8 = R Lastly, Time excels at strengthening one's offense and the ability to close in on the opponent with an extra airdash or 'jump'.
21-9 = L That one seems like it's the hardest to master, but well worth the training.
21-10 = R If you seek to learn more about these techniques, return here to train as I guide you. That will be all for now.
21-11 = N Go to Training Mode to practice with the elements and your execution of special techniques. Combine your normal moves and special moves together to create a deadly string of attacks! Always try new things to overcome your struggles when fighting an opponent.
21-12 = FINISH
