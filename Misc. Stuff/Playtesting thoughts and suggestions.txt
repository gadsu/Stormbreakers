Pushback on attacking player as well to prevent permanently being in the corner.

Increase range on Lynn's basic attacks, currently you need to be right on top of your enemy to land them
Add a slight delay before you're able to jump after a special moves?

Allow both players to separately select rematch or main menu

Randolf can immediately cancel normal attacks into jumps and movement, while Lynn must wait the full duration of her attacks to be able to move again
Randolf still can move while charging Super
Randolf's attacks seem to end much quicker than Lynn's


Bug: Vine Transit jump glitch can be used to escape the stage
Bug: Death Laser won't knock back when your enemy is a certain distance away
Bug: Hitting someone with Death Laser twice while they are against the left wall prevents them from acting at all*
Bug: When characters are attacked(getting hit or blocking) with their backs to the wall, they are unable to be hit until they start moving again
	It actually seems to happen outside of the corner too, but is only noticeable while blocking as pushback is too large for hits.

Balance:
Reiterating need for adding pushback on attacking player
In turn, reduce enemy pushback on regular attacks so that all three standing attacks can connect on the opponent
Increase Lynne's range.
	5A is very short
	5B has Lynne lean backwards as she kicks, reducing her range.
	2A and 2B literally shrink Lynne, making her range shorter
	2B also makes Lynne lean backwards, reducing her range.
	2C should not make Lynne stand.
	
Animations/Art:
Issues with Lynne listed above
Randolf
	All of Randolf's punching attacks come from the same arm, need some more variety
		Ask for suggestions from others if you need help
	2B should have Randolf rise with his body and not his arm
	2C looks good, but the leg he kicks with is shorter than his other leg
	Make sure that the anatomy of Randolf is correct and symmetrical
	Randolf still has the bad ear and it's driving me insane
